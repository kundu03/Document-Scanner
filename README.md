# Document-Scanner
It is an opencv c++ project that can scan a document on a webcam.
It can scan a document considering the fact that the document to be scanned has the largest area among all objects on the webcam.
It is a quite effective project if we have a high quality webcam.
NOTE : All the files and path are according to my system.
